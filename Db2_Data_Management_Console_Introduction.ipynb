    "### The Next Generation of Console for the Db2 database\n",
    "The IBM Db2 Data Management Console is the next step in the evolution of IBM Data Server Manager.\n",
    "This new console builds on the best of Data Server Manager while opening up the platform to exciting new possibilities. This isnâ€™t just a new user interface it is a new way to interact with the Db2 family.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are bringing together the best of our on premises, on cloud and appliance database consoles for the Db2 family in a single experience. We have an new name, IBM Db2 Data Management Console, but you can think of this as Version 3 of Data Server Manager. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much like Data Server Manager, you can install the console on a central server (or your laptop) and manage one to hundreds of databases across the Db2 family from ground to cloud. You can download and install on a Windows, Linux, or now a MacOS machine, and share the interface with your team through a web based console. We will eventually provide the same capabilities you can find today in Data Server Manager. This initial release includes alerts, monitoring, historical data collection, object administration including privilege management, relationship mapping and exploration. You can also edit, run and analyze your SQL with an updated editor and visual explain tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "This version is fully supported for anyone with a Db2 for Linux, UNIX or Windows license entitlement using Db2 Version 10.5, 11.1 or 11.5."

    "Some of the changes are obvious in the user interface. For example the new database over page and the new and improved SQL Editor. \n",
